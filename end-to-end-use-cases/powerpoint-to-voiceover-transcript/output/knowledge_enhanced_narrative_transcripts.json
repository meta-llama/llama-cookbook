Native to this region, they are primarily found in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, and Argentina. Llamas were domesticated in the Andes around four thousand to five thousand years ago and played a central role in the development of early Andean civilizations, including the Inca Empire. They were used for transportation and other purposes. Today, llamas are not endangered and are widely bred and maintained both in South America and globally.
