Llamas have been an integral part of Andean civilizations for thousands of years, playing a central role in the development of early cultures, including the Inca Empire. They were domesticated around four thousand to five thousand years ago and were used for transportation, meat, and other purposes. Llamas are members of the camelid family and are known for their adaptability to high-altitude environments. They are still widely bred and maintained in South America and globally, and are not considered endangered. Let's discover why llamas are so remarkable.",
